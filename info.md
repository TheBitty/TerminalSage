CTF Agent Project Brief for AI Assistants
Project Overview
CTF Agent is an AI-powered terminal assistant specifically designed for Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions and cybersecurity analysis. It combines intelligent command execution with multi-provider AI integration to help security professionals work more efficiently.
Core Concept
A terminal wrapper that provides two modes:

Command Mode: Execute shell commands with AI-powered suggestions and safety checks
Chat Mode: Direct conversation with AI about CTF techniques, tools, and strategies

Key Features & Architecture
1. Multi-AI Provider Support

Local Models: Ollama (deepseek-coder, codellama, llama3) for privacy
Cloud APIs: OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini for power
Automatic Fallback: Switch providers if one fails
Cost Tracking: Monitor API usage and expenses

2. Intelligent Context Management

Problem: Long conversations overflow AI context windows
Solution: Smart compression that preserves important CTF findings
CTF-Specific Importance: Prioritizes flags, exploits, technical discoveries
Model-Aware: Adapts context size to each provider's capabilities

3. Command Safety & Assistance

Safety Validation: Prevents dangerous commands (rm -rf /, dd, etc.)
AI Suggestions: Add ? to any command for help (e.g., nmap?)
Failed Command Help: Automatic AI assistance when commands fail
CTF Tool Integration: Context-aware suggestions for security tools

4. Hardware-Adaptive Configuration

System Detection: Auto-detects RAM, GPU, CPU capabilities
Performance Tiers: High/Medium/Basic/Minimal based on hardware
Smart Recommendations: Suggests optimal models for user's system
Dynamic Switching: Runtime provider/model changes based on workload

Target Users

CTF competitors and teams
Penetration testers
Security researchers
Cybersecurity students
Bug bounty hunters

Technical Stack

Language: Python 3.8+ (async/await, type hints)
Architecture: Modular design with separate components
AI Integration: Multiple provider abstractions
Terminal: readline for history/completion, subprocess for execution
Configuration: JSON with environment variable expansion

Resume/Portfolio Value

Key Design Principles
1. Privacy-First

Local models preferred over cloud APIs
User choice between privacy (local) vs performance (cloud)
No data logging or telemetry without consent

2. Hardware-Agnostic

Works on everything from Raspberry Pi to workstations
Automatic optimization based on available resources
Graceful degradation for limited systems

3. CTF-Focused

Built-in knowledge of security tools and techniques
Context-aware suggestions for common CTF workflows
Integration with tools like nmap, burp suite, gdb, radare2

4. Production-Ready

Comprehensive error handling and recovery
Modular architecture for maintainability
Extensive configuration options
One-command setup and installation

Current Status

Basic architecture designed
Core components specified
Starting with simple single-file prototype
Building incrementally toward full modular system

Immediate Goals

Get basic terminal + AI chat working
Add command suggestions (command?)
Implement safety validation
Add multiple provider support
Build configuration system

Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Complexity First: Start simple, add features incrementally
Context Overflow: Must manage AI conversation length intelligently
Security Gaps: Validate all commands before execution
Poor UX: Should work out-of-box with intelligent defaults
Hardware Assumptions: Can't assume high-end systems

This project showcases real-world software engineering skills while solving actual problems in the cybersecurity domain. The combination of AI integration, systems programming, and security focus makes it particularly valuable for demonstrating technical breadth and practical problem-solving ability.
